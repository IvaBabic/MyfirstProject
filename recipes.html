            <p>All you really need is Shrimp and Sauce:<br><br>
               Sauce. You can’t go wrong with mayonnaise, <br>
               Thai sweet chili sauce, and Sriracha hot sauce.<br>
              However, I suggest adding some red pepper flakes <br>
              and/or a dash of lemon juice to really bring out the flavor!<br><br>
                
               Shrimp. Remember to always peel and devein your shrimp,<br>
               or buy them pre-peeled and ready to go. It’s also best <br>
               to remove the tails before serving, as that makes it easier<br>
               to pop the shrimp straight into your mouth.<br><br>
                
                But if you’re going for aesthetics, leave the tails on. <br>
                You can always chop them off after.<br><br>
                
                Another Tip: using large/jumbo-sized shrimp<br>
                 or 31-count shrimp. That’ll give you about <br>
                 30 to 33 shrimp per pound bag. Use more<br>
                  depending on your party size.
